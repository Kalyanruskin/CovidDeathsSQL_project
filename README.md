## Introduction
The `CovidDeathsSQL_project` repository houses SQL scripts aimed at analyzing COVID-19 vaccination and death data. The project's goal is to delve into the relationship between vaccination rates and COVID-19 mortality on a global scale.

## Files
- `CovidDeathsPortfolioproj.sql`: SQL file containing queries and scripts for data analysis.
- `Coviddeaths.xlsx` : Excel file containing the Covid-19 deaths data.
- `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` : Excel file containing the Covid-19 vaccination data.

## Usage
To utilize the SQL files:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Access the `analysis_queries.sql` file.
3. Execute the SQL queries in a compatible SQL environment or database management system.

## Data Sources
The project relies on COVID-19 vaccination and death data obtained from credible sources, which might include:
- World Health Organization (WHO)
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
- National health departments and official government data repositories of various countries

## Queries
The SQL file includes various types of queries:
- Data retrieval: fetching COVID-19 vaccination and death statistics
- Aggregation: summarizing vaccination rates and mortality figures
- Comparative analysis: examining correlations between vaccination coverage and COVID-19 deaths across different regions

## Results and Insights
The analysis derived from these SQL queries aims to provide insights into:
- Relationships between vaccination rates and COVID-19 mortality rates
- Disparities in vaccination coverage and their impact on death rates among different countries or regions
- Trends and patterns in vaccination strategies and their effectiveness in mitigating fatalities

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the project, add new analyses, or improve existing queries are appreciated. Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests to further develop this exploration project.
